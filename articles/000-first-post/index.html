<p>That seems like a great name for our blog right now. We are probably going to change it when we think of something a bit more&nbsp;exciting.</p>
<h2 id="who-we-are">Who We&nbsp;Are</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bguiz">Brendan</a> is a writer of code, and Amrita is a miner of consumer insights. Neither of us have more than a cursory understanding of what the other does at their nine-to-five. This field, data science, lies at the intersection of what the two of us do, and we figure it is a great opportunity to learn something together, and leverage each other’s&nbsp;strengths.</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<h2 id="blogging">Blogging</h2>
<p>We plan to keep ourselves honest in our efforts by writing about the things that we learn along the way. We will not be posting a step-by-step detailed syllabus of everything we have learnt; rather, we will be doing a highlights reel. We will sprinkle in an interesting video here and there as we go along&nbsp;too.</p>
<h2 id="some-inspiration">Some&nbsp;Inspiration</h2>
<p>Why did we decide to do this - what actually triggered it? Well, for us, we discovered that we were both interested in data science when we watched <span class="caps">TED</span> talks together. Hans Rosling’s talks are always very captivating, and really do exemplify the power of being able to reason about and visualise large, complex data&nbsp;sets.</p>
<p>In that spirit, we are kicking this blog off with a <span class="caps">TED</span> talk given by a statistician, <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_donnelly_shows_how_stats_fool_juries.html">Peter Donnelly, on why statistics is important</a>.</p>
<h2 id="bon-voyage">Bon&nbsp;Voyage</h2>
<p>… and it&nbsp;begins!</p>

        <section class="about"><p>Adventures in Data Science is a blog by <a href="http://twitter.com/bguiz">Brendan</a> and Amrita. We will be using this to chronicle our journey in learning about this exciting new field.</p>
<p>Brendan is a code geek, and Amrita is good at analysing data. Neither of us knows very much about the other’s field. That also makes us perfect for learning about data science together. It is also a sort of a 2014 new year’s resolution for us.</p>
<p>Come tag along for the adventure with us!</p>
