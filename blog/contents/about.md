Adventures in Data Science is a blog by [Brendan](http://twitter.com/bguiz) and Amrita. We will be using this to chronicle our journey in learning about this exciting new field.

Brendan is a code geek, and Amrita is good at analysing data. Neither of us knows very much about the other's field. That also makes us perfect for learning about data science together. It is also a sort of a 2014 new year's resolution for us.

Come tag along for the adventure with us!
