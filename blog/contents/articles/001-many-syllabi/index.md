***Being spoilt for choice is a good problem to have***... but it is a problem nonetheless. Data science is such a broad field, and it covers many different areas. There are many different resources out there which teach many different fields from programming to statistics to analytics. We shall list a few of the resources that we have come across, so far, and plan to use.

## The list

- [Udacity's Data Science track](https://www.udacity.com/courses#!/Data%20Science)
- [edX's Statistics and Data Analysis track](https://www.edx.org/course-list/allschools/statistics-data-analysis/allcourses)
- [Google's Analytics Academy](https://analyticsacademy.withgoogle.com/course)
- [TED talks statistics playlist](http://www.ted.com/topics/statistics)

That is a whole lot of content to get through right there; and that it is just the tip of the iceberg!

Time to get cracking!
